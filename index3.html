The Taj Mahal is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra. <br> It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor,Shah Jahan <br> (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. <br> The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre)complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, <br> and is set in formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.

Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643 <br> but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. <br> The Taj Mahal <br> complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 <br> at a cost estimated at the time to be around 32 million rupees, <br>
which in 2015 would be approximately 52.8 billion rupees (U.S. $827 million). <br> The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans <br> under the guidance of a board of architects led by the court architect <br> to the emperor, Ustad Ahmad Lahauri.

The Colosseum is the great oval amphitheater in the center of Rome gladiators once fought for their     <br>life. The largest amphitheater ever builwas constructed from sand and stone over eight years, from AD72 <br>to AD80colossal structure could hold 80,000 spectators, arranged in a circulararound the central stage. <br>Dramatic and sometimes horrifying events took here, not just gladiatorial games, but also Classical <br>plays, animal huntexecutions. Some say water was even pumped into the arena to enact mocbattles. <br>Partially damaged by earthquakes and stone robbers over the centuthe Colosseum is still an iconic <br>memento of Roman history, visited by thouof tourists every year, so it stands to reason it would make <br>the list of toseven wonders of the world.

The Great Wall of China is a huge barrier that spans thousands of miles along China’s historic northern <br>border. Created over millennia, the wall began its life as a series of smaller walls dating back to the <br>7th century BCE, built as protective barriers against nomadic raids. In 220 BCE, China’s first Emperor <br>Qin Shi Huang masterminded the unification of all China’s walls into one almighty barrier, strengthening <br>and extending the wall to keep out northern invaders. Today the wall is recognized as one of the seven <br>wonders, which, including all its branches, measures a whopping 13,171 miles.

The totemic statue of Christ the Redeemer stands over Rio de Janeiro on the top of Mount Corcovado. <br>  At 30 meters tall, this monument is an iconic emblem of Brazil. This huge public artwork was designed by <br>  the Polish-French sculptor Paul Landowski in the 1920s and completed by Brazilian engineer Heitor da  <br> Silva Costa, and French engineer Albert Caquot in 1931. Made from reinforced concrete clad in over 6  <br> million soapstone tiles, Christ the Redeemer is the largest Art Deco sculpture in the world. Built just  <br> after the end of the First World War, the sculpture was an overpowering symbol of Christianity and hope  <br> when the world had been brought to its knees, so its no surprise that this monument made the list for  <br> today’s seven wonders.

Machu Picchu is a lost treasure of the 15th century, a rare citadel discovered high in the Andes <br>mountains above the Peruvian Sacred Valley. Astonishingly, it is one of the only pre-Columbian ruins <br>found nearly intact, featuring evidence of former plazas, temples, agricultural terraces and homes. <br>Archaeologists believe the citadel was built as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti in around 1450 <br>in polished drystone walls. The Incas abandoned the site a century later and it remained hidden for <br>millennia, before being brought to public attention by American historian Hiram Bingham in 1911. Because <br>of this remarkable preservation, it is recognized today as one of the seven wonders.

Deep in the Mexican state of Yucatán lies Chichen Itza, a historic Mayan city built between the 9th and <br>12th centuries. Constructed by the pre-Columbian Mayan tribe Itzá, the city includes a series of <br>monuments and temples. The most celebrated is El Castillo, also known as the Temple of Kukulcan. It is a <br>huge step pyramid in the center of the city which was built as a devotional temple to the god Kukulkan. <br>In total, the entire temple features 365 steps, one for each day of the year. Even more impressively, <br>during the spring and summer equinoxes, afternoon sun casts triangular shadows down the pyramid’s north <br>stairway that resemble a feathered serpent slithering down its surface, heading towards a stone snake <br>head at the base – no wonder it is one of the seven wonders today!

Petra, the ancient city in southern Jordan, is also known as the ‘rose city’ for its golden hue. It <br>dates as far back as 312 BC. Set in a remote valley, this ancient city was founded by the Arab <br>Nabataeans, a sophisticated civilization that carved stunning architecture and complex waterways out of <br>surrounding rock faces. The Nabateans also established Petra as a successful trade hub, earning vast <br>wealth and a booming population before being wiped out by earthquakes. Unknown to the Western world for <br>centuries, the city was uncovered in 1812 by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt. 19th-century poet <br>and scholar John William Burgon described Petra as “a rose-red city half as old as time.”
